# ML Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file .

## Algorithms Included

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. KMean
6. Perceptron
7. Naives Bayes(Gaussian)

### Note

A major part of the project was adopted directly from the learning material. The motive behind the project is to learn the implementation of Machine Learning algorithm from scratch in Python

## Usage

To use any of the implemented algorithms, simply navigate to the corresponding file and follow the instructions provided. Each algorithm is accompanied by a sample dataset for testing and demonstration purposes.
